# Deep Learning for Facial Recognition Across Ethnicities

This project explores the behavior of deep neural networks applied to facial recognition across various human ethnicities. We compare the performance of six different datasets and two learning methods to better understand the behavior of these networks. Our results show that by using a pre-trained dataset combined with training on a sufficiently large dataset, we can eliminate significant variations in performance. This approach is much more efficient than using untrained neural structures that are unpredictable and inefficient in environments with significant ethnic diversity.

## Introduction

With the evolution of machine learning methods, a growing number of problems are being solved using these tools, particularly those with large datasets. Facial recognition is one of the most significant problems that can be addressed by machine learning, as a digitized image is a massive dataset that requires a robust method to adapt to different scenarios, such as light quantity, photographic angle, headgear (e.g., hats, glasses, etc.), attempts at fraud, distance, image quality, and more. These are just some of the issues that must be addressed to achieve efficiency in this type of problem.

The problem we tackle in this project is understanding how ethnic diversity affects the efficiency of a machine learning algorithm designed to classify and recognize individuals with an operational rate, meaning it can be implemented in a real environment for identification purposes. Our approach not only seeks to understand the problem but also suggests directions for resolving it, whether through data processing, neural structure, or some other method.

Using deep learning algorithms to classify ethnic groups is a significant challenge, as Ahmed et al. demonstrated in their 2020 paper on race estimation with deep networks. For some reason, these structures have significant difficulty dealing with the concept of race, which is so easily recognizable to humans. However, the focus of our project is not on race classification per se but rather on the behavior of the same structure within various racial groups.

## Methodology

Our methodology involved training and testing six datasets of facial images using two learning methods: one that used a pre-trained dataset and another that used an untrained neural structure. We then compared the results of these methods to determine the most effective approach for recognizing faces across various ethnicities.

## Results

Our results show that using a pre-trained dataset combined with training on a large dataset yields the most consistent and efficient facial recognition across ethnicities. In contrast, untrained neural structures are unpredictable and inefficient in environments with significant ethnic diversity.

## Conclusion

The use of deep learning for facial recognition across ethnicities is a promising avenue for further research, particularly in areas where large and diverse datasets are available. By using a pre-trained dataset and training on a sufficiently large dataset, we can achieve greater consistency and efficiency in recognizing faces across various ethnicities.
